1.Build the HTML for the page. Add necessary attributes e.g. placeholder.
2.Add bootstrap and jquery links from some CDN.
3.Add bootstrap classes to format as a form (check getbootstrap.com)
4.Add empty elements for error messages and the success message. */

/* Interactivity:
1.Add handlers on each element to check if the user input meets rules.  
2.Add a submit handler for the form, that is supposed to send data to the back-end (now it will not).
3.If all errors are zero length strings, then show success message and after 1 second reset the form. */
